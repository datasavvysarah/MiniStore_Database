# Store Records Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of store records data, focusing on extracting meaningful insights through data cleaning, exploration, and advanced SQL querying techniques. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights from retail/store operations data.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: Primary analysis tool
- **Database Management System**: PostgreSQL
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**: Subqueries, CTEs, Window functions, Joins

## Data Cleaning Process

The initial data cleaning has been completed and documented in `data_cleaning.sql`. This script handles:

- Data quality assessment
- Missing value treatment
- Duplicate record identification and removal
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Data consistency validation

## Analysis Questions & Objectives

### Primary Research Questions

#### 1. Sales Performance Analysis
- What are the top-performing products by revenue and units sold across all stores?
- How do sales trends vary across different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal)?
- Which store locations generate the highest revenue and profit margins?
- What is the average transaction value and how has it changed over time by store?

#### 2. Store Performance Comparison
- Which stores are the top performers in terms of total sales and revenue?
- How do different stores compare in terms of product mix and sales volume?
- What are the sales patterns and peak hours for each store location?
- Which stores show the most consistent performance over time?

#### 3. Product and Inventory Analysis
- Which products have the highest and lowest turnover rates across stores?
- How does product performance vary between different store locations?
- What is the relationship between inventory levels and sales performance by store?
- Which products contribute most to overall profitability across the store network?

#### 4. Geographic and Location Analysis
- How do sales patterns differ between store locations/regions?
- Which geographic areas show the strongest sales growth?
- What is the impact of store location on product preferences and sales volume?
- How do seasonal factors affect different store locations differently?

#### 5. Operational Efficiency and Store Management
- What are the peak shopping hours and days for each store?
- How do transaction patterns vary between stores (transaction size, frequency)?
- Which stores require operational improvements based on performance metrics?
- What is the average time between restocking and product sellout by location?

#### 6. Revenue and Profitability Analysis
- What are the monthly and quarterly revenue trends by store and overall?
- How do profit margins vary across product categories and store locations?
- What is the impact of promotions and discounts on store profitability?
- Which stores contribute most to overall network revenue growth?

### Advanced Analysis Techniques

The analysis will employ various SQL techniques including:

- **Subqueries**: For complex filtering and nested calculations
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: For readable, modular query construction
- **Window Functions**: For running totals, ranking, and time-series analysis
- **Complex Joins**: For combining multiple data sources
- **Aggregate Functions**: For statistical summaries and KPI calculations

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Revenue Metrics**: Total revenue by store, average transaction value, revenue per store location
- **Sales Metrics**: Units sold, transaction frequency, sales growth rate by store
- **Store Performance Metrics**: Store ranking, comparative performance, market share by location
- **Inventory Metrics**: Turnover rate by store, stock-out frequency, days of inventory
- **Profitability Metrics**: Gross margin by store and product, net profit margin, store contribution to total profits

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Clean Dataset**: Processed and validated data ready for analysis
2. **Analysis Scripts**: Well-documented SQL queries with clear logic
3. **Insights Report**: Summary of key findings and recommendations
4. **Performance Dashboard**: Key metrics and visualizations
5. **Recommendations**: Actionable insights for business improvement

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Access to SQL database management system
- Basic understanding of SQL syntax and concepts
- Raw store records data loaded into the database

### Running the Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute the data cleaning script
   \i data_cleaning.sql
   ```

2. **Analysis Execution**:
   ```sql
   -- Run the main analysis script (once created)
   \i analysis.sql
   ```

3. **Review Results**:
   - Check the results/ directory for output files
   - Review generated reports and visualizations

## Data Sources

- **Transaction Records**: Individual sales transactions with timestamps across multiple stores
- **Product Catalog**: Product information, categories, and pricing
- **Store Information**: Store locations, operational details, and geographic data
- **Inventory Records**: Stock levels and restocking information by store location
- **Sales Data**: Historical sales performance across the store network
